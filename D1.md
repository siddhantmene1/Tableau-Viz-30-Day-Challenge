# Day 1 – 30-Day Tableau Public Challenge

## Project: Breaking Bad – Who Directed It Best?

### Objective
To analyze episode-level data from *Breaking Bad* and identify which director consistently delivered the most highly rated and popular episodes.

---

## What I Did
- Built a **bar chart** showing average IMDB rating by director
- Created a **bar chart** for total U.S. viewership by director
- Designed a **scatter plot** to visualize episode-wise ratings vs. popularity
- Used **color encoding** to represent seasons
- Enabled **interactive filtering** across charts using dashboard actions

---

## What I Learned

### Tableau Skills:
- How to build and format basic bar and scatter plots
- Using **“Use as Filter”** to create interactive dashboards
- Adjusting **axis ranges** to better visualize clustered data (e.g., ratings between 7–10)
- Creating **summary tables** with calculated fields (avg, count, sum)
- Dashboard design and layout tips for beginner storytelling

### Visualization Insights:
- Ratings alone don’t show popularity — viewership numbers add depth
- Directors like Rian Johnson had fewer but highly rated episodes, while others were consistent across multiple seasons
- Importance of using **color** and **tooltip enhancements** to convey layers of information

---

## Takeaway
Even simple visualizations can tell rich stories when combined thoughtfully. This beginner project helped me build a strong foundation in Tableau basics while also exploring the storytelling power of interactivity.
